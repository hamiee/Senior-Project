   Simple GPS Messages, for use in systems that don't need to pass around all
   of the data that comes out of an standard GPS.

   Since this is designed to be a simple message library, the message format is
   limited to a minimal number of fields by design. If you want a more complete
   GPS message, use gps_common from the gps_umd stack.
