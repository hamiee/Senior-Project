Lots of things to do. Time to start writing it down.
- Set up serial input and control for Sonar
- Set up compass polling and output
- Set up bump sensor polling and output

Throw away rosserial:
- Move back to old protocol.h method
- Files to convert:
 - gps.cpp
 - imu.cpp
 - main.cpp
 - sonar.cpp
