Lots of things to do. Time to start writing it down.
- Set up serial input and control for Sonar
- Set up compass polling and output
- Set up bump sensor polling and output

Throw away rosserial:
- Move back to old protocol.h method
- Files to convert:
 - gps.cpp
 - imu.cpp
 - main.cpp
 - sonar.cpp

Notes on protocol.h
- Publisher shouldn't be a subclass of Packet
- templated append function instead of many different functions
- don't template Packet on size
 - will save lots of code space
- don't template Publisher on size?
 - pass in statically-allocated buffer instead?
