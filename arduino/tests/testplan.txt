Test Plans.

In general, consider the questions
- What aren't we testing?
- What are we testing?
- How are we testing it?

1) Serial basics
  can the serial routines send and receive a series of bytes?
  - set the Arduino to echo each byte received individually.
  - send each possible byte, and wait for it to return.

2) Serial stability
  can the serial routines operate over an extended period of time?
  - repeat (1) forever

3) Maximum burst size
  what are the maximum contiguous burst sizes that can be sent and received
  without losing bytes? (per baud rate)
  - transmit one burst per second at increasing sizes until the received burst
    is truncated
  - two tests here; one for transmit, one for receive

4) Serial locking
  can the serial routines enforce packet ordering? Or do we end up with one
  packet inside another. Particularly with respect to serial data queued from
  within an interrupt
  - set up an interrupt and a main thread to transmit on beat frequencies.
  -  each transmits a unique, reasonably-sized sequence. 

5) Maximum baud rate
  what is the maximum baud rate at which the serial routines and link can
  sustain continuous bidirectional transfer?
  * save this for later unless it becomes necessary

6) ROS test
  is rosserial_client working?
  - set up rosserial client and observe that it establishes sync without any
    publishers or subscribers
  - set up rosserial client to publish a simple message once per second. check 
    that it doesn't drop any packets for at least an hour. a day is better.
  - set up a rosserial subscriber to receive simple messages once per second.
    check that none are lost for at least an houre. a day is better.

7) GPS decoder test
  is the GPS decoder working?
  - decode GPS data, pack into ROS message, transmit. verify manually

8) Sonar test
  is the sonar triggering and reception code working?
  - gather and transmit sonar data via ROS. verify manually.

9) I2C test
  are the I2C routines working
  - I don't have a good way to test this without confounding with IMU  

10) Accelerometer Test
  is the accelerometer read routine working?
  - read accelerometer data and transmit via ROS

11) Gyro test
  is the gyroscope working?
  - read gyroscope data and transmit via ROS

12) Magnetometer test
  is the magnetometer working?
  - read raw magnetometer data and transmit via ROS

13) IMU test
  is the IMU fusion code working?
  - measure mean and std dev of IMU variables
  - transmit data via ROS and use intuition
  - do simple rotations and observe output within a reasonable margin (1% ?)

14) Compass tilt-compensation test
  is the tilt-compensation for the compass working?
  - using a circle with 10-degree increments, place the compass at various
    angles and orientations and verify that the output is within a reasonable
    margin
