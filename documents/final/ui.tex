While not directly related to the functionality of the robot, a good user interface makes it much easier to interact with, control and view debugging information from the robot. To that end, I used a Motorola Xoom tablet computer communicating over bluetooth the control the robot. The user interface consisted of a touchable map interface, using data from Google Maps, that reported the position of the user, the estimated position of the robot, and allowed the user to control the robot, via direct control of the motors or by supplying the robot with a series of GPS points to follow, by touching the map.
